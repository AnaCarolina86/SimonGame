# SimonGame


It's the [Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)).

It is a simple game built with JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3. The game starts when shows to the user the first 
button that needs to be pressed, the user press, and then the game shows the next one, and it 
continuos until the user makes a mistake.

In the first version of the game, the user needed to remember all the sequences of buttons with no help. 
It was too difficult to play. So I decided to change it. Now the user sees all the sequences of buttons, the game is
easier and more interactive.
